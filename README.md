# Dev To-Do List

A simple, in-editor to-do list for developers to manage small tasks and ideas directly within their project.

### Features
* **Project-Specific Tasks**: Your to-do list is saved to your current project, keeping your tasks organized and separate from other work.
* **Simple Categories**: Tasks are organized into four clear categories: "Feature Idea," "Left to complete later," "Discuss with team," and "Miscellaneous."
* **Quick Deletion**: Mark a task as complete by simply clicking the checkbox next to it.
* **Dates & Notes**: Add a date or note to each task to provide more context.

### How to Use
1.  **Install the extension** from the VS Code Marketplace.
2.  Open any project folder.
3.  Find the **"Dev To-Do List"** panel in the Explorer sidebar.
4.  **Add a new task**: Click the **"Add Task"** button at the top of the panel to create a new entry.
5.  **Complete a task**: Click the checkbox next to any task to instantly remove it from the list.

### Future Work

* Allow users to define their own categories.
